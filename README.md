Install
=======

Currently, we don't provide compiled binaries. However, we aim at providing means to install `cerberus`
through OS package managers:

* APT for debian-based Linux distributions (a .deb file will be available too).
* Homebrew formula for OSX.
* Whatever Windows package manager.

### From source

`Cerberus` is written in Rust. To install Rust dev tools, go to: https://rustup.rs/

#### From Crates.io

```
$ cargo install cerberus
```

The program will be available in `~/.cargo/bin`

#### From source repository

Clone https://github.com/YoEight/cerberus.git git repository. Once you are in `cerberus` directory run:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

The binary will be in `target/release/` directory.

Common usages
=============

The following usage example don't showcase all parameters variation nor all commands. You need to run
`cerberus --help` to get all supported commands or, `cerberus [COMMAND] --help` to get all parameters supported by a command.

Some commands might require a database user with the right permission. In such cases, you only need to provide `--login` and `--password` parameters.

## Check database connection

```
$ cerberus check
```

Cerberus will automatically check if a node belongs to cluster. If the node does belong to a
cluster, Cerberus will also check if node composing the cluster are reachable.

Cerberus will also return each node version.

## List events

```
$ cerberus list-events --stream foo
```

This command lists every events of the `foo` streams.

```
$ cerberus list-events --stream foo --recent
```

This will command will do the same but will only take the last 50 `foo` 's events.

```
$ cerberus list-events --stream foo --group-id my_group
```
This command lists all parked events that belong to the persistent subscription targetting the stream `foo` and the group
`my_group`.

```
$ cerberus list-events --stream foo --group-id my_group --checkpoint
```
This command is similiar to the previous one but will list all the persistent subscription checkpoints.

```
$ cerberus list-events --by-type user-created
```

This command lists all the events with the type `user-created`

## List streams

```
$ cerberus list-streams
```

This command lists all user-defined streams plus deletion and and metadata streams.

```
$ cerberus list-streams --by-category user
```

This command lists all streams that start with `user-`.

## Create a projection

```
$ cerberus create-projection -k onetime --name amazing-proj --enabled /path/to/projection.js 
```

The name parameter is optional. In this case, the projection named `amazing-proj` will
start right away because of the flag `--enabled`.
