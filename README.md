Usage
=====

The following usage example don't showcase all parameters variation. You need to run
`cerberus [COMMAND] --help` to get all parameters supported by a command.

Some commands might require a database user with the right permission. In such cases, you only need to provide `--login` and `--password` parameters.

### Check database connection

```
$ cerberus check
```

Cerberus will automatically check if a node belongs to cluster. If the node does belong to a
cluster, Cerberus will also check if node composing the cluster are reachable.

Cerberus will also return each node version.

### Create a projection

```
$ cerberus create-projection -k onetime --name amazing-proj --enabled /path/to/projection.js 
```

The name parameter is optional. In this case, the projection named `amazing-proj` will
start right away because of the flag `--enabled`.
